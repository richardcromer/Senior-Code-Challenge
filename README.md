# Senior-Code-Challenge
Completed Exercises for Candidate Employee Code Assessment.

The notes follow suit with the instructions outlined in the test challenge instructions.

I did complete this in Windows and ran using gradleW.  While I expect it will work on Linux/Unix I did not run there to verify. 

All of the files should be consistent with the ask on the instructions.  

There is a new TestImpl file for the Candidate object.   Both the create and read are being unit(JUNIT) tested. 

To support proper date time JSON conversion (serializing/deserializing) I did import a new library and autowired the objectmapper to support conversion in JSON.   In short, please use my files as I added a few niceties to avoid using strings everywhere.
